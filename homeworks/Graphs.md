    "\n",
    "There are more plots on the graph than required. The axes' labels are vague and poorly defined. A curve with distinct values on the x and y axes or a multiple bar graph would be preferable ways to visualize the graph. Overall, it appears from the graph interpretation that Germany is seeing a rise in COVID instances relative to the UK, and towards the conclusion, this trend begins to reverse. However, from a wider perspective, the specific details remain unclear.\n",

    "\n",
    "The lack of units on the graph's axes causes the graph to appear hazy. The title and the curve's legends are the only ways to understand that temperature cooling is observed for various values of alpha; the graphic fails to provide the necessary information on which units.There is ambiguity between the curves and the distinction between two curves ( alpha 60 and alpha 70) seem identical.\n",

    "\n",
    "Basic data is shown on the graph year-by-year, with appropriate curve legends. The overall information for each brand  can be examined even though the axes have no defined units. Each plot can be shown through a point and the axes with appropriate legends would have made the graphic much better. At the middle, there is  is ambiguity between the curves, and also, a black-and-white graphic would not clearly depict the curve distinction.\n",
