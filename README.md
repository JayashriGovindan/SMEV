https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/passport-for-open-science-a-practical-guide-for-phd-students/

- A list of view points are mentioned here - [Document](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/analysis/2023-12-14_Article_View_Points.pdf), highlighted the key points for easier go through!

- A short quick summary:
1. The State of Open Data : Overall, the paper underlines the facts about the survey undergone, the difficulties and developments in data management strategies, shows the knowledge gap,  and stresses the need to standardize the process of exchanging data. There were intersting facts on real data and I gained a wider perspective on open data from the article.
2. The Passport for Open Science : The material helped me understand that we could freely share our thesis work by submitting it to peer-reviewed online journals, publishing it in easily accessible publications, taking part in online forums, and sharing our data and code. Adopt best practices, make use of trustworthy formats, keep up with developments in open research, and ask for help when needed.

### 10 - Scientific integrity
### Homework:
- [x] Play with the DoE Shiny Application.
Started analysing with random trail experiments. [Experiment Page - user_c2727](https://arnaud-legrand.shinyapps.io/design_of_experiments/?user_c2727)

### 10 - Incremental DoE: A Bayesian perspective, Reinforcement Learning and Surrogates (Bandit, GP)
### Homework:
- [x]  Playing with the DoE Shiny Application. My way of basic expermentation on DoE Shiny App. [Experimentation Report](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/code/design_of_experiment_analysis.ipynb)
- [x]  Added explanatory comments that was suggested on earlier linear model experiment. Linear regression model with own data - [Code](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/code/linear_regression_model_practice.ipynb) and with M2R-ParallelQuicksort data - [Code](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/code/parallel_quick_sort_linear_model.ipynb)
- [x]  Pick a topic and prepare a short presentation.
My topic was on Chatbot technology.
1) The first one was a general overview of Chatbot, the usecases, the weakness and recommendation to overcome difficulties on its usage. It ends with the thoughtful quote: “Current technology focuses on chatbots learning to talk but not to think!”.
2) The second one seemed very interesting (also quite emotional to read on :) ) , it was a DadBot created by Mr. James in remembrance of his dad who passed away due to lung cancer. The technology intends to restore and preserve memories, so promoting a more sustainable and meaningful manner of remembering and connecting with the past.
My detailed review on both with respect to the 4 criterias mentioned. [Chatbot Article Review PPT](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/analysis/2024-01-18_Chatbot_Article_Review_PPT.pdf).
( A draft report before i was making the PPT. [Draft Report](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/analysis/2024-01-18_Chatbot_Article_Review_Draft.pdf) )
### Progress:
- [x] MOOC Completion: All the modules and exercises completed.
Peer-evaluation: Reviewed for 2 other peers, where one was reproducible and overall good. Other was only partially reproducible and study of experiment seemed incomplete. Awaiting for response of my submission from other peers. [Simpsons Paradox Report](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/code/simpsons_paradox_peer_evl_analysis.ipynb)
