## SMPE - Scientific Methodology and emPirical | exPerimental Evaluation
### 1 - Introduction to the scientific method and computer science epistemology
### Homework:
- [x] Read Popper's text
- [x] Indicate your name on the CodiMD Pad. You will use to collaborate and fill in all the information you can.
- [x] Register on the Mattermost. This is the preferred communication mode.
- [x] Set up a *public* github or gitlab project for this lecture. You will take notes on this lecture and turn your homework and computational documents in this project.
- [x] Register to the MOOC.
- [x] Follow modules 1 + 2 of the MOOC with as much exercises as possible (except the last one of module2, on /Challenger/; watching interviews is optional).
- [x] Set up a computational document system (e.g., Rstudio, Jupyter, OrgMode) on your laptop.
- [x] Report the URL of your git project, your mattermost ID on the CodiMD Pad.

### Progress Note:
- Registered Pad: [CodiMD Pad Access Link](https://codimd.math.cnrs.fr/Dai2ZzqzTwezOMZVIyMN-g#)
- Registered Mattermost: [Mattermost Access Link](https://framateam.org/smpe-2023-2024/channels/town-square) , ID: @jayashrigovindan
- Registered MOOC: [MOOC Access Link](https://lms.fun-mooc.fr/login?next=richie/en/courses/reproducible-research-methodological-principles-transparent-scie/) , ID: jayashrigovindan
- Github repo: https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE 
- Computational Document System setup done for Jupyter Notebook, Rstudio, Emacs - OrgMode.
- MOOC - Modules 1 completed along with all the quiz and exercises; Module 2 is in process.

### 2 - Visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis | Descriptive statistics; Correlation, causality, and spurious correlation
### Homework:
- [x] Start learning R by reading this R_crash_course notes.
- [x] Criticize every figure of Jean-Marc's slides by:
   1. Applying the checklist for good graphics;
   2. Proposing a better representation (hand-drawing is fine) that passes the checklist.
 - [x] Report this work for at least 3 figures on your github/gitlab project.
 - [x] MOOC: Complete exercise 5 of module 2 (/Challenger/). Write a short text explaining what is good and wrong about this document (you may want to provide an updated version of the notebook) and upload on your github/gitlab space.
       
### Progress Note:
- [R_crash_course.rmd](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/code/r_crash_course_practice.Rmd) practiced using RStudio env.
- Applied checklist for good graphic and analysed for 3 figures - [Graphic_Analysis](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/analysis/2023-05-10_Graphic_Analysis.md)
- Module 2 completed along with all the quiz and exercises.
- Exercise 5 of MOOC Module 2 - [Brief Analysis on Shuttle - Challenger](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/analysis/2023-05-10_Challenger_Analysis.md)

### 3 - Processing data with the Tidyverse, Data curation, beautiful viz with ggplot
### Homework:
- [x] Use good naming and organization conventions in your repos.
- [x] Complete the Challenger exercise if you haven't done so.
- [x] Engage in module 3 of the MOOC and choose a topic for the peer evaluation (final task of module 3).
- [ ] Here is an opportunity to practice your data curation/analysisskills by producing the [[file:../2022_10_Grenoble/03_Names-Methodo2022-exercise.Rmd][First name/last name analysis in a computational document]]. I encourage you to use =dplyr= and =ggplot= for this analysis.
      
### Progress Note:
- Organised git repos and added free MIT license.
- MOOC - Module 3 is in process.
- Topic choosen for peer evaluation: "Autour du Paradoxe de Simpson". (Seemed interesting to analyse this data!)
- First Name analysis - started with data exploration & visualizations, yet to comment on it and complete the whole analysis.
  [Progress](https://github.com/JayashriGovindan/SMPE/blob/main/code/name_analysis.ipynb)
  
### 4 - Data management tips (Data Tools) and introduction to confidence interval.
### Progress Note:
- MOOC - Module 3 completed along with all the quiz and exercises.
- Started working on the peer evaluation task -  Paradoxe de Simpson
