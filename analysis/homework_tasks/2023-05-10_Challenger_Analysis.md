# Space Shuttle - Challenger 
## Brief analysis on its cause of failure
Any real-time experiment should take an extensive range of data into consideration during testing. Regarding the space shuttle launch, temperature is one crucial factor that needs to be considered from a larger perspective.
According to data analysis, there are no observations for low temperature conditions, which is what caused the shuttle to fail this time.
The frequency of failure vary distinctly at varied temperatures, eg: observed at 58 F, 63 F and 75 F with 200 psi.The frequency with which things happen is random. The temperature influence estimation shows that there is no discernible effect of temperature on malfunction studies, which ought to have been given top priority.
