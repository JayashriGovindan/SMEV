# Space Shuttle - Challenger 
## Brief analysis on its cause of failure
- Any real-time experiment should take an extensive range of data into consideration during testing. Regarding the space shuttle launch, temperature is one crucial factor that needs to be considered from a larger perspective. 
- According to data analysis, there are no observations for low temperature conditions, which is what caused the shuttle to fail this time.
- The frequency of failure vary distinctly at varied temperatures, eg: observed at 58 F, 63 F and 75 F with 200 psi.The frequency with which things happen is random. 
- The temperature influence estimation shows that there is no discernible effect of temperature on malfunction studies, which ought to have been given top priority.
